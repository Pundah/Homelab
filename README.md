## What is a homelab?
A homelab is a personal setup of hardware and software designed for learning, experimentation, and practice with various technologies. It typically involves building a small-scale IT infrastructure that replicates real-world environments, allowing users to explore concepts in networking, virtualization, system administration, and more.

A homelab can include servers, storage devices, and networking equipment, and is often used for running virtual machines (VMs), containers, and other services. Itâ€™s ideal for:

- Learning new skills (e.g., Linux administration, cloud technologies, or networking protocols).

- Testing and developing software in a controlled, private environment.

- Running personal services (e.g., file servers, media servers, home automation, or web applications).

- Experimenting with virtualization tools like Proxmox, VMware, or Docker, and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

Homelabs can vary in complexity, from a simple setup using a single machine or a few virtualized environments, to more advanced systems involving multiple physical servers, networking gear, and distributed storage solutions. The primary goal is hands-on experience with IT systems, providing practical knowledge that can be applied in professional environments.
